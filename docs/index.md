# Overview

**[KataLib](https://github.com/noembryo/KataLib)** is a Windows program that can play, convert and organize music (or video) files.    

This is a Layout with all the application's panels enabled.

![FullViewWithCollections.png](images/FullViewWithCollections.png)

The user interface consists of the **[Toolbar](#the-toolbar)**, the **[Transport](#transport)**, and three panels, the **[Playlist](#playlist)**, the **[Library](#library-collections)** and the **Properties**.  
- The **[Playlist](#playlist)** panel is where we can drop or add local media files or YouTube links for playback, conversion or metadata editing.  
- The **Library** panel has two views:
  - The [Library Collections](#library-collections), where the contents are virtual Collections, consisting of tracks from local files and/or YouTube links.  
  - The [Library Tracks](#library-tracks), where the contents are the media files of any folder we add to the library.  

- The **Properties** panel is where the metadata of the selected track, either from the Playlist or the Library, are displayed.  
  If the Library Collections are shown and a Collection is selected, the **Properties** panel shows the Collection's tracks instead.  

The panels can be toggled on/off, by the **Layout** menu on the bottom right of the main window.  

The size, position and configuration of the program's window can be saved as a "Layout", and can be easily re-applied from the **User Layouts** sub-menu of the **Layout** menu, or from the menu of the **Preferences** toolbar button.  

There is also an alternative view of the app, the [**Compact View**](#compact-view)...  
![CompactViewTrans.png](images/CompactView.png)  
...that consists of only a Main player window and the **Playlist** and **Properties** independent windows, that can be moved around or turned on/off, to conserve screen space.

While using KataLib, keep in mind that almost all the user interface controls, buttons, etc. have a Tooltip, that briefly explains what they do.  
This Tooltip is shown when you hover your mouse over the corresponding control.  

___

Generally, KataLib can be seen as three programs in one:  
A Player, a Converter and a Librarian.

- **A Player**

    As a Player, it can play any music or video file that we drop on it from the library or from the file explorer. It can load Winamp playlists and can also download YouTube links and/or playlists and play them.  
    By selecting one or more tracks we can do many things like: edit metadata, copy, move, convert or even download the video file itself (if it's a YouTube link track).  

- **A Converter**  

    As a converter, it can [convert](#convert-dialog)
    from these types of audio files...
    
    - ".mp3" - MPEG Audio Stream, Layer III (lossy)
    - ".aac" - Advanced Audio Coding (lossy)
    - ".m4a" - MPEG-4 Part 14 (audio only) can contain AAC (lossy) or ALAC (lossless) stream
    - ".ape" - Monkey's Audio (lossless)
    - ".ogg" - Ogg/Vorbis (lossy)
    - ".oga" - Ogg/Opus Audio (lossy)
    - ".opus" - Opus Interactive Audio Codec (lossy)
    - ".flac" - Free Lossless Audio Codec (lossless)
    - ".ac3" - Dolby AC-3 (lossy)
    - ".wma" - Windows Media Audio (lossy)
    - ".wav" - Waveform Audio (lossless)
    - ".aif" - Audio Interchange File Format (lossless)
    - ".mp4" - MPEG-4 Part 14 multimedia (extracts the aac audio stream)
    - ".mkv" - Matroska Multimedia Container (extracts the audio stream)
    - ".avi" - Audio Video Interleaved Container (extracts the audio stream)
    - ".mov" - QuickTime File Format (extracts the aac audio stream)
    - ".flv" - Flash video (extracts the aac audio stream)
    - ".wv" - WavPack (lossless)
    - ".mpc" - Musepack AKA MPEGplus (lossy)
    - ".mp2" - MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (audio only) (lossy)
    - ".mpga" - MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (audio only) (lossy)
    - ".mpeg" - MPEG-1/2 (extracts the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II audio stream) (lossy)
    - ".webm" - WebM - can contain Ogg or Opus (lossy)
    - ".dts" - DTS - Digital Theater Systems
    - ".m4b" - MPEG-4 Part 14 (audio only) (lossy) used for audiobooks
    - ".dfs" - Direct Stream Digital file (lossless) (convert-only)
    
    ... to these types of audio files  
    
    -   ".mp3" - MPEG Audio Stream, Layer III (lossy)
    -   ".m4a" - MPEG-4 Part 14 (audio only) containing AAC (lossy) stream
    -   ".aac" - Advanced Audio Coding AAC (lossy)
    -   ".ogg" - Ogg/Vorbis (lossy)
    -   ".opus" - Opus Interactive Audio Codec (lossy)
    -   ".flac" - Free Lossless Audio Codec (lossless)
    -   ".wav" - Waveform Audio (lossless)

- **A Librarian**

    As a Librarian, it uses a database to store and display two distinct types of data.  
  - The [Library Collections](#library-collections)  
    who are virtual playlists of local media files and/or YouTube links.  
  - The [Library Tracks](#library-tracks)  
    which are the properties of local media files (Tracks).  

___

## Portable mode

KataLib can also start in a **Portable** mode using a "-p" argument to the shortcut or by running the `KataLib Portable.exe`.  
In the Portable mode the app reads its settings, db, etc. from a `portable_settings` directory inside its folder and not from the Windows current user's settings.  
Using the Portable mode while the app is installed inside the `Program files` directory is not advised, because Windows treat this folder in a special way.  
Any other directory or removable drive is ok, as long as the user can write on it. 

___

## The ToolBar

The ToolBar is at the top of the main window. It contains buttons that can be used to perform various actions.  
These buttons can change or be disabled, depending on the currently focused panel of the app.  
Right-clicking on an empty space of the Toolbar, brings up this menu...  

![MenuToolbar.png](images/MenuToolbar.png)  
...that lets us change the ToolBar icons' size and appearance.

The permanently visible buttons are:  
  ![Toolbar1.png](images/Toolbar1.png)

1. **Convert**  
  Opens the [Convert dialog](#convert-dialog) to configure the way you want to convert the selected track(s).

  There is a drop-down menu when we click the arrow next to the button.  
  This **Library Folders Menu** has shortcuts to the **Add Folder** and **ReScan Folders** buttons (see [Library Folders details](#library-folders-window)).

# Detailed info


### Playlist

The Playlist panel is the main part of the Player.  
We can drag audio files or playlists here or use the **Find** button to search YouTube or our Collections for tracks.  
The loaded Tracks can be used for Playback, get Converted to various formats, saved as a playlist, etc.  

![PlayerView.png](images/PlayerView.png)

The buttons that we find under the Playlist are:

- **Repeat** - makes the player start from the beginning when the last Track is played out. 
- **Shuffle** - makes the player play in a random order. 
- **DJ** - opens the [DJ sub-panel](#dj-sub-panel) that lets us crossfade the playing track with the next.
- **Find** - opens the [Find Tracks](#find) dialog to search for Tracks in the Playlist, YouTube or the Library Collections.
- **Playlist** - just opens the [Playlist menu](#playlist-menu).


#### DJ sub-panel

![DJ.png](images/DJ.png)  
The DJ controls are:
- **Auto**  
  If active, it will automatically start cross-fading the next track when the remaining seconds of the currently playing track are equal to the **Duration**.
- **XFade**  
  Pressing this will start a crossfade instantly.
- **Duration**  
  The cross-fade's duration in seconds.
- **Type**  
  Select the fade in/out curves here.
- **Level offset**  
  This is the next track's starting level percent. The track will fade in from this level to the 100% playback level.
- **Position offset**  
  Here we can select the next track's starting position.
- **CrossFader**  
  Do a crossfade manually.  
  Moving this slider, simultaneously changes the volumes of both the playing track (lower as the slider moves to the right) and the next track (louder as the slider moves to the right).  
  At the far right, the crossfade ends, and the slider returns to its initial position.  

#### Find

Pressing the **Find** button opens the **Find Tracks** dialog that lets us search for Tracks at the following places.  

- **YouTube** 

  ![FindYouTube.png](images/FindYouTube.png)  
  We can search **YouTube** for a song, and if we find it we can **Add** it to the Playlist.  
  The Clear Playlist button can be used to remove all the tracks from the Playlist, before we add the new-found ones.  
  If the **Playlists only** checkbox is checked, searching YouTube will return only Playlists, and if we add one of those, all its tracks will be added to our Playlist.  
  The **Clipboard Text** button lets us see the YouTube addresses that exist in the clipboard or to type one of our own.

- **Collections**

  ![FindCollections.png](images/FindCollections.png)  
  We can also search for **Collections** in our Library, or for specific Tracks inside these Collections (if the **Track search** is checked).  

- **Playlist**  
  ![FindPlaylist.png](images/FindPlaylist.png)  
  Finally, we can search the currently loaded **Playlist** Tracks for a specific track,  and **Play** it. 



### Transport

![Transport.png](images/Transport.png)

Mostly, self-explanatory playback controls: 

- **Position bar** - Shows the position of the currently playing Track and lets us jump to a specific point. 
- **Previous Track** - Go to/Play the previous Track.
- **Stop** - Stop playback.
- **Play/Pause** - Toggles Play/Pause. 
- **Next Track** - Go to/Play the next Track. 
- **Tap Tempo** - Opens the Tap Tempo dialog that lets you manually measure the BPM of the Track and add it to its metadata. 
- **Time Display** - Shows one of a variety of times, that can be selected either by the menu that opens when right-clicking, or by cycle through with left-clicking on it:
  - Time Elapsed 
  - Time Remaining
  - Total Time Elapsed
  - Total Time Remaining
- **Mute** - Mutes/Un-mutes the audio output. 
- **Volume** - Changes the volume of the audio output. 


### Compact View

![CompactViewDetails.png](images/CompactViewDetails.png)

This is a minimal view of the app, that consists of only a small, resizable Main window, that shows mostly the Cover Art of the currently playing (or selected) track and the Transport that controls the playback.  
The transport is like the **Full View**'s [Transport](#transport), only smaller.  

Above the Transport, there is the title of the currently selected/playing Track and two extra buttons that open/close the Playlist and Properties windows.  
Double-clicking this title text, will show the file in Explorer or the YouTube url in the system's browser.  
Double-clicking the Cover Art will open the [Edit Metadata](#edit-metadata) (or [Multi](#multi-edit-metadata)) dialog if the Track(s) have metadata.  
Right-clicking the Cover Art will create a [context menu](#compact-view-menu) with additional options.  

All the **Compact View** windows have a **Close** button (**x**) that closes them.  
The Playlist and Properties windows have the same functionality as in the **Full View**, and also some more buttons.  
The **Lock** button, locks the position of the window relative to the Main window, so when we move the Main window, the locked window moves with it in the same way.  
Additionaly, the Playlist window have a **DJ** button to open the [DJ panel](#dj-sub-panel) of the Playlist, and the Properties window has an **About** button to open the [About](#about) window.  

### Library Collections

When showing **Library Collections**, every row consists of the Collection's name, number of tracks, custom tags, total duration etc.  

![CollectionTypes.png](images/CollectionTypes.png)  

There are three types of Collections
- YouTube Collections that use YouTube Playlist address url
- Spotify Collections that can use a Spotify Playlist, Album or Podcast list address url
- Custom Collections that can contain any number of local/YouTube tracks and don't use any address url

Favorite Collections can also get **Starred** and use this attribute for filtering or sorting. 

We can create Collections from the Playlist's right-click menu, we can add tracks to existing Collections, we can remove tracks from them, we can delete existing Collections, drop them to the Playlist for playback etc.  



### Library Tracks

When showing **Library Tracks**, every row consists of some basic info (like file size or file type), some info that is contained inside some music files (like Artist or Title) and finally some info that we provide ourselves and aids us into organize our collection (like tags or rating).  
To get the music files into the library, we must provide the program with their location.  
This is done by pressing the **Library Folders** toolbar button.  
In the **Library Folders** dialog we can add/remove folders to/from the library.  
Only folders can be added to the library, not individual files.  
We can re-scan folders to update the library with the changes in their contents, and by checking or un-checking them, we can make them visible or not.  
By selecting a file in the library we can see its properties in the **Properties** panel (if its visible).  
By clicking again on any cell we can edit the contents of that cell. Editing a cell changes the contents of the library but also the metadata of the file itself.  
The file's metadata can be edited either directly by clicking the cells or by pressing the **Metadata** toolbar button.  
This will open the **Edit Metadata** dialog.  
If more than one file is selected when pressing the button, the **Multi Edit Metadata** will open and the changes there will affect all the selected files.  
The selected files can get copied or moved anywhere and also can get converted to many other audio formats with the built-in Converter.  
They can also be played back, but to have them advance automatically (like a list) the Player's Playlist must be empty.



### Convert dialog

A dialog to select the conversion settings.  

 ![Convert.png](images/Convert.png)

The usual workflow of a convertion, is to uncompress the files to `.wav` file format, and then re-encode them with the selected encoder.  

Besides the main settings for the encoders, like the _Compression Type_ and the _Quality Control_ of the conversion, there are a few more settings:

-   **Input downmix**  
    This option down-mixes multichannel audio files (5.1, 9.1 etc.) to stereo or mono streams.
-   **Intermediate wav bit depth**  
    This affects the intermediate (or final) wave file's bit depth.
-   **Output Sampling rate**  
    This changes the sampling rate of the encoding.
-   **Output MP3**  
    This affects only the MP3 encoding. It changes the channel algorithm.  
-   **Change Volume**  
    Raises or lowers the volume of the converted tracks.
    -   **Max** (Disabled if `Change Volume` is not enabled)  
        Normalizes the volume of the tracks.  
        Raises or lowers the volume to maximum (before clipping). 
-   **Keep average level at**  
    Keeps the average level of the tracks close to this value.  
    The default value is -18. Going closer to 0 raises the average level.  
    <ins>_**Don't use levels close to 0, because the sound will get distorted!**_</ins>
-   **Trim Silence**  
    Removes the silence from the beginning and ending of the track.
-   **Truncate/Split**  
    Opens an extra dialog that lets you [Truncate](#truncate) the track to a certain length or [Split](#split) it into multiple tracks. 
-   **Keep location**  
    Saves the converted tracks at the same directory as the source tracks (Links are saved to the Download folder).  
    <ins>_**Be careful not to overwrite the original files with the converted ones.**_</ins>
-   **Join (re-encode)**  
    Create one continuous track by joining the selected ones.  
    The files will get uncompressed, joined, and then re-compressed.  
    (Enabled only when more than one tracks of the same format are selected)

The **Reset All** button restore the default settings of the dialog.  
**Convert** starts the conversion process, while **Close** just closes the dialog (but keeps all the changes made).

### Edit Metadata

  ![MetaEdit.png](images/MetaEdit.png)

This dialog lets us edit all the track's metadata and also change its filename.  

We can **Copy** and **Paste** metadata (including the Cover image).  
When the Paste is pressed, a **Paste Options** dialog will open, letting we choose what fields from the copied metadata will be pasted.  

There are some "convenience" buttons that require more explanations.
1. This button just opens the **Download Cover** dialog and starts the search automatically (saving us from some extra clicks)
2. This button guesses the missing fields by automatically searching for metadata using any already available tag (works only  for Title, Artist, Album, Track number and Year).
3. These buttons just close the current track's metadata dialog and automatically open the next (or previous) one.

There is also the option to **Search Metadata** from the internet, as long as we provide at least a title for the track.  

The **Get Lyrics** button searches the lyrics for the current track.  
If some lyrics are found, they are added to the comments _after_ any already existing text.

All the changes that are made in this dialog are not written to the file until either the OK or the Next/Prev arrow buttons are pressed.

### Multi Edit Metadata

  ![MetaEditMulti.png](images/MetaEditMulti.png)

Opens the dialog to change the metadata from all the selected files at once.  
Only the checked (enabled) entries will affect the files.  
If there is no value in a checked (enabled) entry, the respective metadata will be erased.  

Some convenience buttons are:
- **Auto numbering starting from**  
    If the **Track Nr.** is checked, the selected tracks are getting a new Track number, sequentially, starting from the number set here. 
- **Get Lyrics**  
    This button works a little different here.  
    It searches the lyrics for all the selected tracks, and if some of them are found they are automatically added to the respective metadata.   

Of course, nothing is really written to the files until the OK button is pressed. 

### Filter

The **Filter** function help us narrow down what is displayed in the Library.  
Depending on the display mode of the Library (Collections or Tracks), this button opens up different dialogs.

#### Filter Library Collections

 ![FilterCollections.png](images/FilterCollections.png)  
With this dialog we can filter the Collections using their tags.  
We can select multiple tags and we have the options to: 
- Show Collections containing all the selected tags
- Show Collections containing any of the selected tags
- Show Collections containing none of the selected tags

The _"star"_ button lets us filter using only the **Favorites** Collections, while the "**x**" button clears all the selected tags.  
There is also a number next to every tag name, that depicts the number of Collections that use this tag. 

#### Filter Library Tracks

 ![FilterTracks2.png](images/FilterTracks2.png)     
![FilterTracks.png](images/FilterTracks.png)  
With this dialog we can filter the Tracks using their path, their metadata, such as Artist, Album, Title, Genre, Tags, Rating, or All the above.  
Pressing the **Filter** button updates the view and pressing the **Clear** button resets it.  
If the checkbox on the **Filter** button is checked, the view is updated as we type, but that can be laggy if the Library shows many files.  
We can also use boolean operators (OR, AND, NOT in full capitals) with our keywords.  
E.G. `Pink Floyd AND Animals`  
will show us all the Pink Floyd tracks from their "Animals" album. 

### Library Folders window

![FolderManager.png](images/FolderManager.png)

Manage the Library Folders that contain all the Library Tracks.  
Here we can:

- **Add folder** opens up a folder selection dialog to add a folder to the library.  
  All the music files in the selected folder and the folders inside _that_ selected folder will be added to the library.  
  Any folder entry that happens to also be a subfolder of another folder entry will be removed as superfluous.  
  Of course the files will still be in the library.
- **Remove Selected** removes the selected (not the checked) folders from the library (but not from the disk).
- **ReScan Folders** re-scans the folders of the library to update the metadata if changed and to add new files or remove deleted files if the contents of the library folders are changed.
- **Checked** If Checked is _checked_ (!) only the _checked_ (!!) folders will be scanned if the **ReScan** button is pressed.  
  Otherwise all folders are scanned.
- The **All** checkbox checks/un-checks all the folders

The checkmark in front of a folder also determines if the contents of that folder will be visible to the library.  
We can also drop folders here from the file explorer to be added to the library.  

### Preferences

**Subtitles**  
We can change the font and position of the subtitle text (for video files that have subtitles). 

#### YouTube Settings

![Prefs3.png](images/Prefs3.png)

-   **Audio stream**  
    The YouTube's audio stream that will be used for the conversion.
-   **Check clipboard for links**  
    Check the clipboard for any text that contains a video or a playlist address from YouTube.
-   **Trim silence**  
    Trims the silence from the beginning and ending of the track.
-   **Keep average level at**  
    Keep the average playback level of the YouTube tracks close to this value.  
    The default value is -18. Going closer to 0 raises the average level.  
    <ins>Don't use levels close to 0, because the sound will get distorted!</ins>
-   **Add the resolution number to the video filename** when saving a video from YouTube.
-   **SubTitle encoding**  
    This is the encoding (UTF-8/ANSI) that it will be used for the saved subtitle file.
-   **Player to open YouTube links**  
    Select which player we want to use, to handle YouTube links (like VLC or Media Player Classic) 
-   **Downloads folder**  
    This is the directory where the files from YouTube will be downloaded.
-   **Use SSL verification**  
    Disable this if you have problems getting information for the YouTube tracks.

#### Paths

![Prefs4.png](images/Prefs4.png)

Here we select the paths to the executables that the app uses to
- Convert audio files (like FFMPEG, LAME, OGG, OPUS and NeroAAC)
- Externally edit a track (four different choices)
- File manager to handle the file links (if not the default Windows Explorer)

#### Advanced

![Prefs5.png](images/Prefs5.png)

**No relative paths in Playlists**  
The Playlists can have both absolute and relative paths.  
The relative paths work only if the position of the playlist remain in the same relation with the position of the files, as it was originally saved.  
So if both are moved and keep their position relation the playlist will work.  
To move only the playlist and not the files, all the paths must be absolute.

**Fast loading for Playlist tracks if more than**  
Fast load tracks using the basic properties and get the rest of the info when possible.

**Prompt to send log after crash**  
If the program crashes, it will ask if we want to send the crash log to the developer for debugging. 

**Use natural sorting for Library paths**  
Normal (alphabetical) sorting gets "Track 11" before "Track 2" but is ~15% faster.  
Natural sorting, sorts numbers in paths as expected (e.g. X1, X2, X11).

**Use global hotkeys**  
Control the playback even when KataLib's window is in the background.  
Pressing the **Change** button opens a dialog that let us select which keyboard combination will do what action.  
For the default settings check the [Shortcuts](#shortcuts) section at the end.


**DataBase**

- **Backup db**  
  Backup the database file for safety.
- **Restore db**  
  Restore the database from a safety copy.
- **Compact db**  
  Compact the database file to save some space.

**Multi-Processing**

- **Threads**  
  The threads (or cores) that the program will use to do parallel processing of multiple tasks.
- **Automatically select**  
  The program will select the number of threads based on the number of physical cores of the processor.

### About

### Truncate/Split Track

In this dialog we can choose to Truncate the start and/or end of the selected track, or Split it into multiple different tracks.  
We use numbered fields to do this and the **Preview** button lets us audition the results of our changes. 

#### Truncate

![TruncateTrack.png](images/TruncateTrack.png)

This dialog has just two numeric fields in Hours:Minutes:Seconds, to set the start and end of the track.  
The values are automatically set to the start/end of the track when we first open it.  
The resulting track will have the same metadata as the original one.

#### Split

![SplitTrack.png](images/SplitTrack.png)

When we first open this dialog, it contains only one slice that shows the **Start** of the first slice of the track, that _has_ to be 00:00:00 (non-editable).  
Pressing the **Plus (+)** button lets us add a new slice of the track, while pressing the **Minus (-)** button removes the selected slice.  
Clicking on the **Title** column of any slice, lets us change the title of that slice, and consequentially change the title/filename of the resulting track.  
The **Start** field of all slices (other than the first) are editable, and we can preview our changes using the **Preview** button.  

All the resulting tracks will have a copy of the original track's metadata, except the Title and the track number.  
The Title will be the slice's title, and if we check the **Hash (#)** button, the slice number will be the track number in their metadata.  

The **Import cue/txt** button lets us import the offset times from a *.cue or a *.txt file.  
The `*.cue` format is standard, but the format of the `*.txt` file should be:

* One track/slice per line
* Time in the form of `Hours:Minutes:Seconds` or `Minutes:Seconds`
* The format of every line must be one of the below:
  * Time **+** A blank space **+** Title of the track (_e.g._ "14:53 This is a title"), or
  * Title of the track **+** A blank space **+** Time (_e.g._ "This is a title 01:03:46")

Dropping a `*.cue` or `*.txt` file on the dialog will import the times as well. 

### Rename

![Rename.png](images/Rename.png)

This dialog lets us rename the selected file(s) using a pattern with variables.  
The variables are:  

{0} = ARTIST  
{1} = TITLE (or FILENAME if no TITLE)  
{2} = ALBUM  
{3} = TRACK NUMBER  
{4} = FILENAME  
{5} = PLAYLIST ROW  
{6} = GENRE  
{7} = YEAR  

It can also create directories by using the \\ character.  

Example: {7} {2}\\{0} - {1}  

Produces: ..\\1998 NYC Live\\Portishead - Sour Times.mp3
